This project is part of the PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience hosted on Forage. It simulates a real-world consulting scenario where I analyzed customer churn patterns and financial risk for a telecom client. The goal was to uncover actionable insights that help reduce customer attrition and improve revenue retention strategies.

Using Power BI, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and created interactive dashboards that visualize key metrics such as customer tenure, contract types, service usage, payment methods etc. Through DAX formulas and visual storytelling, I built dynamic reports that reveal churn trends, customer segments at risk, and revenue impact.

The dashboard provides executives with clear, data-driven insights and recommendations to improve customer loyalty and minimize financial exposure.

ðŸ”§ Key Skills: Power BI, DAX, Data Visualization, Business Analytics, Churn Analysis, Financial Risk Assessment

ðŸ’¼ Project Outcome: Delivered a professional-level dashboard with clear KPIs, slicers, and visualizations to support strategic business decisions.
